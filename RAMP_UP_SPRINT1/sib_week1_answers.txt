1.)Routes tell Flask what URL should trigger a function. A function can be given a name which is used to generate urls for that particular function, and returns the message we want to display in the user's browser.

2.)App is the only route that has been specified so far. 

3.)The name is the method that get's called once we hit the route.

4.)from flask import Flask
app = Flask (_name_)

@app.route ("/")
def hello():
	return "Hello World!"

if_name_=="_main_":
	app.run()


6.)What is the 'base case' where we don't call 'blastoff' again?

We don't call blatoff agian when n = 0.	


7.)What is the "simpler' form of out input.('n') that we pass into 'blastoff'?

The temporary variable. Could be a number, or a string. 


8.)

 The 'for' loop in index.html: It's going loop through all the message and display the flashed message.

<pre>
	{% for message in messages %}
			{{message}}
		{% endfor %}
</pre>
